Fix the for-loop in validate_cache_entries(), in the file
read-cache.c; see 8616a2d0cb57865540f1c00ac2e5385a6cc5d84e for the
full context. [v2.38.1]

The exclude_cmds() function, in help.c, seems to assume that the
inputs are already sorted.  This is fine, but it seems like that may
not be a guarantee, in the one case that it *is* called, elsewhere in
the same file.  It looks as if main_cmds gets sorted if exec_path is
true, and other_cmds gets sorted if env_path is true, but they aren't
both *guaranteed* to be true simultaneously (even if that *is* the
case "most of the time" - because the other some of the time we'll get
buggy behavior). [v2.38.1]

On line 88 of repository.h, "repositories" should be
"repository's". [v2.38.1]
