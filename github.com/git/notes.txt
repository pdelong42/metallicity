Things that look like bugs at face value:

Fix the for-loop in validate_cache_entries(), in the file
read-cache.c; see 8616a2d0cb57865540f1c00ac2e5385a6cc5d84e for the
full context. [v2.38.1]

The exclude_cmds() function, in help.c, seems to assume that the
inputs are already sorted.  This is fine, but it seems like that may
not be a guarantee, in the one case that it *is* called, elsewhere in
the same file.  It looks as if main_cmds gets sorted if exec_path is
true, and other_cmds gets sorted if env_path is true, but they aren't
both *guaranteed* to be true simultaneously (even if that *is* the
case "most of the time" - because the other some of the time we'll get
buggy behavior). [v2.38.1]

On line 88 of repository.h, "repositories" should be
"repository's". [v2.38.1]

At path.c:1229, it doesn't seem like "C:" will ever match. [v2.38.1]

In abspath.c:77, it seems like strbuf_realpath_1() can be implemented
in a better way than using a goto statement. [v2.38.1]

See whether in setup.c:1101-1102, item->string can be replaced with
ceil, or with &ceil. [v2.38.1]

See about restructuring read_gitfile_gently(), in setup.c:806-879, to
eliminate the need for goto statements. [v2.38.1]

See about restructuring is_git_directory(), in setup.c:345-383, to
eliminate the need for goto statements. [v2.38.1]

See about restructuring strbuf_realpath_1(), in abspath.c:77-200, to
eliminate the need for goto statements. [v2.38.1]

See about restructuring interpolate_path(), in path.c:731-770, to
eliminate the need for goto statements. [v2.38.1]

Reverse the sense of the if() enclosing git-compat-util.h:491-500, to
reduce gratutitous indentation (same for 498-499). [v2.38.1]

reverse the sense of hte if() enclosing most of the body of
git_parse_unsigned() in config.c:1189-1216. [v2.38.1]
