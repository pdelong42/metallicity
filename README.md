I like to read the code of lots of different projects.  I keep track of where I
am with a script or a text file, which acts as a bookmark, telling me what tag
I have checked-out, etc.  This was starting to get unwieldy.

Then I hit upon the idea of creating a meta-repo, which references the repos
I'm reading as sub-modules.  Right now it's still in the beginning phase.
