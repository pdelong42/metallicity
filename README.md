I like to read the code of lots of different projects.  I keep track
of where I am with a script or a text file, which acts as a bookmark,
telling me what tag I have checked-out, etc.  This was starting to get
unwieldy.

Then I hit upon the idea of creating a meta-repo, which references the
repos I'm reading as sub-modules.  Right now it's still in the
beginning phase.

I'm still not exactly sure how the name applies to the project
in-particular.  I just wanted something with "meta-" in it, I wanted
to make it a play on words, I wanted it to sound cool, and I'm
somewhat of a astronomy/cosmology nerd.  But I'm still looking for a
back-justification which uses the word as a pun, or attributes to it a
double-meaning of some sort.
