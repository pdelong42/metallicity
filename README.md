I like to read the code of lots of different projects.  I keep track
of where I am with a script or a text file, which acts as a bookmark,
telling me what tag I have checked-out, etc.  This was starting to get
unwieldy.

Then I hit upon the idea of creating a meta-repo, which references the
repos I'm reading as sub-modules.  Right now it's still in the
beginning phase.

I'm still not exactly sure what the name means.  I wanted something
with "meta-" in it, and I wanted to make it a play on words.  I also
think it sounds cool on its own, and I'm a bit of an
astronomy/cosmology nerd.  But I'm still looking for a
back-justification which uses a pun or double-meaning of some sort.
